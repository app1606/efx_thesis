# Several Stories about High-Multiplicity EFx Allocation

## Description
This repository contains code for "Several Stories about High-Multiplicity EFx Allocation" article, which developed from my Bachelor thesis. Our work is focused on fair allocations which are EFx and PO simultaneously. In this repository two different EFx allocations counting approaches for two-agent instance are implemented: brute force and ILP. For ILP implementation we used LattE, the software for lattice points counting.

## Repository description & Usage 
1. `latte-integrale-1.7.4` dir contains [LattE](https://github.com/latte-int/latte) library (one has to build/install)
2. `barvinok_counter` - notebook with Latte usage (input generation for the problem) for counting
3. `brute_force_EFx` - notebook with brute force method, some statistics and visualisation
4. `pdfs` - important pdf files such as conference presentation and the text of the article
